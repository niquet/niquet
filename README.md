Hi there 👋 nice to meet you! I'm Max—a Software Engineer with relentless curiosity, from how operating systems work all the way to scalable system design.

Early in consulting, fresh out of a CS degree, I saw teams miss out not from technical barriers, but from missing the point—curiosity and communication make or break success.

I challenge assumptions, dig deep into the fundamentals, and turn “boring” work into real team progress. I’m not here to re-invent the wheel—I’m here to keep the team inspired and moving forward, always asking the “why” others miss.

Today, I bring this mindset to backend teams I work on. I don’t just code; I unblock teams by obsessing over the fundamentals, motivate with positivity, and find the real issues. The result? We solve problems once and right, boost momentum, and get back to building software that scales, delights users, and pushes boundaries.
