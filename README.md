### Hi there 👋 nice to meet you
I'm **Max**, a Go enthusiast with a strong passion for backend engineering and computer networking. I enjoy writing dev tools and improving my soft skills. Having spent a lot of time training my own foundational language models before chatGPT was a thing, I'd rather learn myself than have machines do it for me.
