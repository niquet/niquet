### Hi there 👋 nice to meet you
I'm Max, an ambitious computer scientist that has one too many interests. In summary, I was put on earth to solve issues using the right tools for the job. Some of the tools I ❤️ include talking about requirements, software engineering, machine learning and technical writing.

You wouldn't consider these "tools", would you? Well, they are. Communication 📣 is a powerful tool, that helps align teams on a mission. Requirements engineering prevents you from solving the wrong problems using the wrong languages, frameworks or techniques. Technical writing makes sure future contributors and stakeholders can get up to speed effectively. Software engineering 💻 is also just a tool for getting the job done. You abstract some problem from the real into the digital world using efficient strategies to achieve as little overhead as possible. Lastly, machine learning 🤖: a tool. A great one! However, you need to use it wisely as not every problem should be solved with the help of machine learning ([Find out more here.](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf))

Now that you got a taste of how I think, let's talk specifics. Here's some info about me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my portfolio in areas such as open-source, machine learning, web development and developer tools
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things, including backend engineering using Python and Golang, deep learning using PyTorch and Tensorflow, and frontend engineering using React.js (please help me focus)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with data engineering for efficient data processing, model training and evaluation on custom datasets
- 💬 Ask me about my dog, my passion for cheese and my opinions on german beer

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite software engineering tool is a pen & a sheet of paper because it's so easy to solve problems first and then implement a solution afterwards. I used to try it the other way around, but that just surfaces the perfectionist within me and I start overcomplicating things.
