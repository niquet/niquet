Hi there 👋 I’m Max—a Software Engineer driven by relentless curiosity, from operating systems to scalable system design.

Fresh out of a CS degree, I saw teams stall—not from technical barriers, but from missing the point. Curiosity and clear communication make or break success.

I challenge assumptions, dig into the fundamentals, and turn “boring” work into progress. I’m here to solve problems once and right, build software that scales and delights.

Today, I bring this mindset to backend teams I work on. I focus on unblocking, motivating with positivity, and finding a simpler way forward.
