Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maxâ€”a Software Engineer driven by relentless curiosity. I'm obsessed with challenging assumptions, digging into fundamentals, and turning "boring" work into real progress.

Fresh out of a CS degree, I saw teams stallâ€”not from technical barriers, but from missing the point. That led me to focous on solving problems and building software that scales and delights.

Today, I bring this mindset to backend teams. I focus on unblocking challenges, motivating with positivity, and finding the simpler path forward.
